# wow-he-made-a-todo-list
## Brian Prost

I learned AngularJS. No, not the new Angular. Not even last year's Angular.

Unfortunately, that AngularJS that I learned isn't the cool kid on the block anymore. As such, I have been exploring the different front-end frameworks that are popular today, namely:

1. React
2. Vue
3. Svelte

I have been reading a lot between these three, but it's time to 'get my hands dirty' and make some simple todo lists with all three to really get a feel for how they all work.
